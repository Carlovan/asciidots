# Wait.dots

### Purpose
This librairy generates a range of one-spaced values between two integers. It is similar to the range function of python, the firt value is included but the last one is not.

### Usage
    
     O
    A+B
     E

##### Parameters
- `A`: The beginning value, included in the range 
- `B`: The end value, not included  
- `O`: The output, the dots generated will be emitted from the top
- `E`: When the loop is finished a dot goes from the bottom.

##### Example

This is a count to 10 example

    %!for_in_range.dots f

         /-$_#
         |
    .-#1-f-11#-.
         |  
         |
         \-&

##### Output

    12345678910 

### Notes
- Once the end dot is emmited, you can send other dots in the lib to use it again
